# Court-Grottedden-Final
This project is our Final Exam in our Intro to Python course with UNW

In the last week of the course you are going to write a database program with your team that will store information about various students.  There should be at least 7 fields for the database.  Now create a mainline that will display the information in the database and allow the user to edit any record.  Show that you can share programs with GitHub, and include a link to your repo along with screenshots in your submission.
