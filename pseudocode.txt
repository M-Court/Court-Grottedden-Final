Test Code:
    If this file is executed directly:
        Create a DatabaseConnection object.
        Clear the table.
        Create a test Entry object with:
            name = "Ray", date = "November 12", book_of_bible = "Genesis",
            main_character_or_event = "Creation", 
            standingout_verse = "Genesis 1:1: 'In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth'",
            time_spent_min = 22, practical_action = "An action".
        Add the test Entry to the database.
        Print the first entry from get_entries().


Initialize a Tkinter window.

Create input fields for:
    Name
    Date
    Book of the Bible
    Main Character or Event
    Standout Verse
    Time Spent
    Practical Action

Create a button labeled "Add Entry".

When "Add Entry" button is clicked:
    1. Read data from input fields.
    2. Validate that all required fields are filled.
    3. Create a new Entry object using the input data.
    4. Call the add_entry method of DatabaseConnection to add the Entry to the database.
    5. Show a success message or error message if something goes wrong.

Run the Tkinter main loop.
