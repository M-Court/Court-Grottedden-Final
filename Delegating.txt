This is a text file to keep track of what we each are doing

tasks to be done...

    -   create tkinter "entry" button (I like designing tkinter. i could do this pretty easily)
    -   connect tkinter button with the methods it will run
    -   create 4 methods
            1.  add_entries
            2.  get_entries
            3.  reconnect
            4.  disconnect
    - create a connection to the database     (not as familiar with database. you?)
